********* About Project ***********

This project aims to create a desktop application that utilizes several libraries to create user friendly data visualization tool.Users can input a csv file to veiw all 
the columns, plot data and can use various features of plotting. This is a very easy way to analyze and visualize any data.
The project uses four python libraries :- Tkinter,Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn. Tkinter is used for creating a GUI, while Pandas is used to manipulate and analyze data.
Matplotlib creates static, interactive and animated  visualization, while Seaborn focuses on statistical plots.
By combining this libraries, the tool provides users with the ability to explore and analyze their data in various ways. Users can load & veiw data through user interface
with Tkinter, manipulate data with Pandas and visualize data with Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project ultimately provides a flexible and powerful solution for data 
visualization.

********** Learning ************

During making of this project I have learned about data visualization using matplotlib and Seaborn. These two libraries intrigued me and gave me an idea of 
combining this libraries with GUI[Graphical User Interface]. I explored different types of plots, what else extra features we can add to this plots, about subplots 
and lot more. I also explored more about Tkinter module like how to add more than one screens in single project and how to write on a particular screen.
This project has helped me improve better and knowing more about this libraries

********* Why do you want to be a MLH Fellow **************

I want to become a MLH Fellow becuase MlH fellowship is an internship alternative where accepted fellow get to work with some
of the top tech companies [like google and meta] and contribute to open source peojects. I think I will gain real world experience
working as a fellow. I had never done internship before,I have no prior experience and this is my first attempt to apply for an internship,
and i believe MLH Fellowship will help me gain some experience in my field. I want to learn new things,explore new things and 
i want to be a part of group project and work with the best people. Beacuse, I think working with best people and 
getting guidance from them can make me better than what i am, which will help me a lot in my career. I want to explore
myself that where did i stand and how much potential do i have to complete any given task.
Working in an internship not only pays you but also teaches you lot of things.Money that you earn from an internship will not 
stay with you forever but the learning and knowledge you gain will stay. Also i want to join a community where i can meet new
people who have some extra talent in them, it is such a great honour talking with them,working with them.
I think this is a great platform that can guide me and bring the best out of me and can help to reach me to my maximum limits.

*********** What experience will i bring in fellowship ************

To be honest this is my first attempt of applying for an internship, I had no prior experience so i cannot bring any experience to fellowship. I am applying for this 
internship because if i get selected then it will be an opportunity for me to gain some experience, know my potentials and learn more new things. But I can promise you that i Will do the best possible thing i can. 
I am hardworking,focused and determined.It is possible that not every person applying for an internship must have some experience, the most important thing is how 
serious he/she is about the work assigned to them and i can assure you seriousness in my work.
My Perspective is to teach everyone that programming is not just about learning a language or memorizing syntaxes, modules, in-built functions, that is not programming.
The real programming is when you feel a language, when you explore it and try to use it some real world project using your creativity and observations. Programming is a 
way of solving our daily life problems. Language is just a source but when you use that source and combine with your thinking, at that moment you are called a real
programmer.No one is born a specialist, when he/she loves his/her work, explore it thoroughly and studies it deeply then he become a specialist of that field.
So this is the perspective that i can bring being a fellow.

************ what else do we know about you ********************

Let me discuss my journey as a programmer, so I was a normal student who had no knowledge about programming and got an admission into computer science and engineering.
There were few people who already knew about programming and had their hand over programming languages like rust, java, and skills like front-end dev, full stack 
development, which made me nervous and tensed, i started thinking of how to compete with these people. But i never carried this nervousness with me, 
i take that as a motivation of learning new things and i started learning programming.The First programming language that I learnt was C language then I learnt Python.
Pyhton intrigued me and started exploring in python, I also learned Blender but had not given much time to blender. I studied various libraries of python and finally 
able to create a project that i can present to MLH Fellowship.So this is my journey of programmming till now and I want to learn more that's why i am applying for 
MLH Fellowship program to explore new world.
